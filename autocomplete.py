Time Complexity:    O(N + MlogK) where

                    -   M is the number of sentences starting with given subquery

Space Complexity:   O(T * M) where

                    -   M is the average length of frequency HashMap for each Trie Node
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : No
Here, we are maintaining a dictionary at every trienode in order tpo prevent a whole traversal and find the sentences
with that prefix. We are using a priority queue to get top k elements
